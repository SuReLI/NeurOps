# NeurOps
A python implementation of growing and pruning in neural networks.

TODO:
* Encapsulate growing/pruning fan-in and fan-out weights (dealing with different layer types) within a model class
* Tutorials
* Implement optimizers with neuron-wise step counts & learning rate schedules
* Implement NORTH* metrics
* Prepare blog post
* JAX implementation
* Julia implementation
